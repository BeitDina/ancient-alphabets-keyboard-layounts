BabelMap is a free character map application for Windows that allows you to browse through the entire Unicode character 
 repertoire of nearly 144,000 characters, or search for a particular character by name or by code point. 
Characters can then be copied to the clipboard for use in any Unicode-aware application. 
It also provides many useful features and special utilities. 
BabelMap supports the most recent version of the Unicode Standard, currently Unicode 14.0 (released September 2021).
version 14.0.0.2 (2021-09-19) BabelMap once again runs on Windows Legacy from 2000 to Windows 10.
